# dbfiddle

For now this repo contains the code for the front end and fiddle database, not the back-end engines. I intend to add all of those once I clean up the code. The plan is to include a cloudformation script that will spin up a bare metal EC2 with KVM for the full VMs and running firecracker. You would never run like this due to cost but it's a good way of documenting the setup, so you know you can set up your own back end server if you need to.
